sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart

Please note, some of my commenters have mentioned that if youâ€™re using NOOBs you may need to use the LXDE-pi folder which would mean you need to use the following instead.
sudo nano /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart

As you can probably guess this is a file that runs when your pi boots.
To disable the screensaver add a # to the beginning of the line, this comments the line out.
@xscreensaver -no-splash

Next add these lines underneath the screensaver line
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank

This disables power management settings and stops the screen blanking after a period of inactivity.
Now that is done we should prevent any error messages displaying on the screen in the instance that someone accidentally power cycles the pi without going through the shutdown procedure. To do this we add the following line underneath the lines you just added.
@sed -i 's/"exited_cleanly": false/"exited_cleanly": true/' ~/.config/chromium/Default/Preferences

Finally we need to tell chromium to start and which page to load once it boots without error dialogs and in Kiosk mode. To do this add the following line to the bottom of this autostart file.
@chromium --noerrdialogs --kiosk http://www.page-to.display

Thanks to a comment from Rikard Eriksson below it seems you may now need to add the incognito flag to ensure no warnings are displayed if you pull the power without first shutting down see below.
@chromium --noerrdialogs --kiosk http://www.page-to.display --incognito
As I understand it, Chromium is now Chromium Browser so you need
@/usr/bin/chromium-browser --kiosk --disable-restore-session-state /home/pi/Portand ChildrensMuseum..../index.html
